description: Project Task Tracking and Completion
---

1. When a new task is identified (bug, feature, improvement), add it as a checkbox item to the "Open Tasks" section of .windsurf/tasks.md.
2. When a task is completed, move it to the "Completed Tasks" section with a note referencing the commit or PR that resolved it.
3. Review .windsurf/tasks.md before each handoff or release to ensure all tasks are up to date and no open tasks are forgotten.
4. Do not close any task without a completion reference.
5. If a task is urgent or blocks other work, mark it as **[priority]** in the list.
