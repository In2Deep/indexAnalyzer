# Project Tasks

This file is the canonical, visible list of tracked tasks for the project. All new tasks, bugfixes, and feature requests should be added here and checked off when complete.

## Open Tasks

- [ ] Fix CLI to accept `--name` as a global argument. The current CLI only accepts positional arguments, so running with `--name` fails. Update argument parsing to support `--name` as documented, and ensure all commands use it for project namespacing.

## Completed Tasks
