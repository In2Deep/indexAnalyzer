## Completed Tasks

- Fix line number extraction in src/ast_parser.rs to use real AST node locations for all entities (function, class, assignment). Add tests and follow all workflows. (commit d4d9958)

- [x] Fix CLI to accept --name as a global argument. The current CLI only accepts positional arguments, so running the application with --name fails. Update argument parsing to support --name as documented, and ensure all commands use it for project namespacing. (Completed in commit 2bbd8a6; note: 1 integration test failure remains for follow-up). in Redis. (commit: c83692b)
