All project tasks must be tracked in .windsurf/tasks.md. Any new bug, feature, or improvement must be added as a checkbox item under "Open Tasks". When a task is completed, it must be moved to the "Completed Tasks" section with a brief completion note. No task may be closed without a reference to the commit or PR that resolved it.
